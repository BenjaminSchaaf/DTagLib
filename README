== Building ==
    Just run build.bat, then e.g. run:
        tagreader "C:\My Music\track.mp3"

== Requirements for Building TagLib ==
    TagLib is already distributed in this binding, but if you want to build it you need:
    
    TagLib from:
        http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
    
    Zlib Dev package from:
        http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
        
    Cmake from:
        http://www.cmake.org/
    
== Building TagLib ==
    Extract TagLib.
    Extract zlib dev package to TagLib directory.
        Rename zlib/lib/zdll.lib to zlib.lib

    Create a `build` directory in the TagLib directory and CD to it.
    
    Run:
        cmake -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\include" -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\lib\zlib.lib" -G "Visual Studio 10" ..

    Note: Replace "D:\dev\lib\D\" to wherever you've extracted TagLib.

    Build the ALL_BUILD project in the taglib.sln solution in Release mode.

    In the `bindings\c\Release` directory, copy tag_c.dll to your project folder.
    In the `taglib\Release` directory copy tag.dll to your project folder.
