== DTagLib ==
    This is a D wrapper library of the TagLib library (abstract API only).
    
    The library has been tested on Windows XP 32bit and Ubuntu 32bit systems.
    
    This project is still in alpha stage, things might break at any moment.

== Building ==
    On Windows:
        dmd .\build.d && .\build.exe
        
    On Linux:
        dmd ./build.d && ./build
        
    This will build the library and the sample applications.
    
    Linux Note: On Linux the aplication has to be able to find the 
    C TagLib shared library, or it won't be able to run.
    
    You can do guarantee this in several ways:
    
    1. Temporarily add the location to TagLib (this depends on where it was installed,
    it depends on your OS). For Ubuntu 10.10, running an example like this works:
    
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./dtagreader
        
    2. Try adding a line containing '/usr/local/lib' to /etc/ld.so.conf and run:
        sudo ldconfig

    3. Put the libtag_c.so.0 shared library in the root of your project.

== Requirements for building TagLib DLLs on Windows ==
    TagLib DLLs are already distributed in this binding, but if you want to build them yourself you need:
    
    TagLib from:
        http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
    
    Zlib Dev package from:
        http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
        
    Cmake from:
        http://www.cmake.org/
    
== Building TagLib DLLs on Windows ==
    Extract TagLib.
    Extract zlib dev package to TagLib directory.
        Rename zlib/lib/zdll.lib to zlib.lib

    Create a `build` directory in the TagLib directory and CD to it.
    
    Run:
        cmake -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\include" -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\lib\zlib.lib" -G "Visual Studio 10" ..

    Note: Replace "D:\dev\lib\D\" to wherever you've extracted TagLib.

    Build the ALL_BUILD project in the taglib.sln solution in Release mode.

    In the `bindings\c\Release` directory, copy tag_c.dll to your project folder.
    In the `taglib\Release` directory copy tag.dll to your project folder.

== Building TagLib shared libraries on Linux ==    
    TagLib might already exist as a precompiled package, see your package manager
    if that's the case.
    
    Otherwise, see the INSTALL file in the TagLib sources. Usually the command to build
    and install is simply:
    
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release .
        make
        sudo make install

== Using DTagLib ==
    TagLib is straightforward to use. Simply instantiate a TagFile class with the path
    of an audio file:
        
        auto tagFile = new TagFile(r"C:\My Music\Artist - Track.mp3");
        
    And then read/modify the file's tags, and read any audio information if you want to:
        
        with (tagFile.tags)
        {
            writeln(artist);  // read
            year = 2000;      // modify
        }
        
        writeln(tagFile.audio.samplerate);  // audio properties can only be read

    After you're done with a tagFile you should call close() on it to release the
    file handle.
    
    Also see the various examples in the samples folder.
