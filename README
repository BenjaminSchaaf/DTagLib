== DTagLib ==
    This is a D wrapper library of the TagLib library (abstract API only).
    
    The library has been tested on Windows XP 32bit.
    
    This project is still in alpha stage, things might break at any moment.

== Building ==
    Build the wrapper library:
        .\taglib\build.bat
        
    Build the samples:
        .\samples\build.bat

== Requirements for building TagLib DLLs ==
    TagLib DLLs are already distributed in this binding, but if you want to build them yourself you need:
    
    TagLib from:
        http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
    
    Zlib Dev package from:
        http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
        
    Cmake from:
        http://www.cmake.org/
    
== Building TagLib DLLs ==
    Extract TagLib.
    Extract zlib dev package to TagLib directory.
        Rename zlib/lib/zdll.lib to zlib.lib

    Create a `build` directory in the TagLib directory and CD to it.
    
    Run:
        cmake -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\include" -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH="D:\dev\lib\D\taglib-1.7\zlib\lib\zlib.lib" -G "Visual Studio 10" ..

    Note: Replace "D:\dev\lib\D\" to wherever you've extracted TagLib.

    Build the ALL_BUILD project in the taglib.sln solution in Release mode.

    In the `bindings\c\Release` directory, copy tag_c.dll to your project folder.
    In the `taglib\Release` directory copy tag.dll to your project folder.

== Using DTagLib ==
    TagLib is straightforward to use. Simply instantiate a TagFile class with the path
    of an audio file:
        
        auto tagFile = new TagFile(r"C:\My Music\Artist - Track.mp3");
        
    And then read/modify the file's tags, and read any audio information if you want to:
        
        with (tagFile.tags)
        {
            writeln(artist);  // read
            year = 2000;      // modify
        }
        
        writeln(tagFile.audio.samplerate);  // audio properties can only be read

    After you're done with a tagFile you should call close() on it to release the
    file handle.
    
    Also see the various examples in the samples folder.
