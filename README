== DTagLib ==
    This is a D wrapper library of the TagLib library (abstract API only).
    
    The library has been tested on Windows XP 32bit and Ubuntu 32bit systems.

== Building ==
    On Windows:
        dmd .\build.d && .\build.exe
        
    On Linux:
        dmd ./build.d && ./build
        
    This will build the library and the sample applications.
    
    Linux Note: On Linux the aplication has to be able to find the 
    C TagLib shared library, or it won't be able to run.
    
    You can do guarantee this in several ways:
    
    1. Temporarily add the location to TagLib (this depends on where it was installed,
    it depends on your OS). For Ubuntu 10.10, running an example like this works:
    
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./dtagreader
        
    2. Try adding a line containing '/usr/local/lib' to /etc/ld.so.conf and run:
        sudo ldconfig

    3. Put the libtag_c.so.0 shared library in the root of your project.

== Requirements for building TagLib DLLs on Windows ==
    TagLib DLLs are already distributed in this binding, but if you want to build them yourself you need:
    
    TagLib from:
        http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
    
    Zlib Dev package from:
        http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
        
    Cmake from:
        http://www.cmake.org/
    
== Building TagLib DLLs on Windows ==
    To be updated. For now use the distributed DLLs

== Building TagLib shared libraries on Linux ==    
    TagLib might already exist as a precompiled package, see your package manager
    if that's the case.
    
    Otherwise, see the INSTALL file in the TagLib sources. Usually the command to build
    and install is simply:
    
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release .
        make
        sudo make install

== Using DTagLib ==
    TagLib is straightforward to use. Simply instantiate a TagFile class with the path
    of an audio file:
        
        auto tagFile = new TagFile(r"C:\My Music\Artist - Track.mp3");
        
    And then read/modify the file's tags, and read any audio information if you want to:
        
        with (tagFile.tags)
        {
            writeln(artist);  // read
            year = 2000;      // modify
        }
        
        writeln(tagFile.audio.samplerate);  // audio properties can only be read

    Also see the various examples in the samples folder.

== Todo ==
    - Make more examples, maybe utilizing a GUI library like gtkD.

== Contributors ==
    Johannes Pfau tested and verified that DTagLib works on Linux.
    He also contributed with DTagLib and TagLib patches and helped improve the
    memory management of DTagLib. Thanks, Johannes!
